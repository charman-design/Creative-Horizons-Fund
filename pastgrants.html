              The Creative Horizon Fund has supported a diverse range of
              artistic projects, including solo exhibitions, gallery shows, and
              public art installations. By empowering artists through their
              chosen mediums, the fund has helped bring their visions to life.
              One such exhibition in Soho showcased the work of a talented
              artist, marking a pivotal stepping stone in their promising
              career.

            In this capstone project, Pace University musical theater student
            Ethan Brooks took the stage to showcase his remarkable talent in a
            performance of Phantom of the Opera, made possible by a Creative
            Horizon Fund grant. The production was outstanding, offering Brooks
            the chance to shine in the spotlight. This pivotal project paved the
            way for his Broadway debut, where he now performs in the main cast
            of Little Shop of Horrors!
